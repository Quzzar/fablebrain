# FableBrain

FableBrain is an innovative project that leverages the power of generative AI to create "fables" as abstract representations of memory. This TypeScript application, developed using [Bun](https://bun.sh/), is a unique approach to conceptualizing and storing memories in the form of fables, encapsulating lessons learned and fostering longer-term memory retention.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system.
-   And Node.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone <repo>
    ```
2. Navigate to the FableBrain directory:
    ```
    cd fablebrain
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    bun i
    ```

### Running FableBrain

To start FableBrain, simply run:

```
npm run start
```

This command starts the server. Add fables and see output using the API.

## Development

FableBrain is currently in a development phase, and we are actively working on enhancing its capabilities. Our roadmap includes:

-   Improved AI algorithms for more nuanced and diverse fable generation.
-   Enhanced memory retention mechanisms.
-   User interface for interactive memory input and fable visualization.
